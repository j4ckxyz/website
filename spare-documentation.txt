Hi there! This is the text file of all of the spare bits of code for the thebrewergame/websites GitHub repo, the source code of the website thebrewergame.com. The documentation below covers a variety of things around the website in descending order of appearance.

ALTERNATE EMAIL COPY BUTTON FUNCTIONALITY
Currently, the email copy button works by switching the text of the button once clicked for five seconds before reverting it back to the original text. However, this was not the first version of the implementation. The first version involved sending an alert to the browser that read "hello@thebrewergame.com has been copied to the clipboard!" This functionality can be used by replacing the code in the emailButton.addEventListener function at the bottom of index.html with the following:


alert("hello@thebrewergame.com has been copied to the clipboard!");


For reference, the current implementation is coded as follows:


function resetEmailButton() {
    emailButton.textContent = "(or click to copy hello@thebrewergame.com)";
}

emailButton.addEventListener("click", function() {
    emailButton.textContent = "hello@thebrewergame.com has been copied to the clipboard!";
    setTimeout(resetEmailButton, 5000);
});


("emailButton" is the ID of the copy email button.)

SOCIAL COLOR LINKS
Social Color Links refers to whether or not the social platform links underneath the header "Find me elsewhere across the internet:" are colored with their respective platform colors. To achieve the coloring, src/styles/styles.css includes HTML classes for each of the platforms with their respective background colors, at the bottom of the file. Then, index.html calls on these classes through the [class="[class name]"] portion of the links just before the associated platform name. Below is an example of the X (formerly Twitter) button without the coloring:


<a href="https://x.com/thebrewergame" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X (formerly Twitter)</a>


...versus with, as introduced in thebrewergame.com v1.8:


<a href="https://x.com/thebrewergame" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="twitter">X (formerly Twitter)</a>


It is that [class="twitter"] that calls the respective HTML classes. To remove the coloring, you may either remove the [class="[class name]"] parts of the links in index.html, or remove the classes themselves in src/styles/styles.css, which look like the following as of thebrewergame.com v1.8:


.twitter{
    background-color: #008AD8;
    color: white;
}

.instagram{
    background-color: #F56040;
    color: white;
}

.substack{
    background-color: #FF6719;
    color: white;
}

.airchat{
    background-color: #3170e7;
    color: white;
}

.youtube{
    background-color: #FF0000;
    color: white;
}

.twitch{
    background-color: #6441a5;
    color: white;
}

In the case of thebrewergame.com/website, we keep the classes in src/styles/styles.css, and instead just remove the [class="[class name]"] from the links.

ANNOUNCEMENT BANNER
The Announcement Banner is an element of the website intended to be placed underneath the social links that can draw attention to something, say, well, an announcement. It features a header, paragraph, and space for links. It can be found just underneath the code for the social links, identifiable as the HTML class "announcement-banner." To take the banner live, fill the content as approperiate, remove the tags around the above <br> making it a comment, and in styles.css, find .announcement-banner and remove or switch to a comment the "display: none;". Then the banner is up and running! For reference, this is the default content for it when unused to say hi to the sneaky people using Inspect Element:

the header (h2): Shhh...
the paragraph (p): If you're reading this, it means that you're poking around where you shouldn't be. This surrounding code is for a hidden announcement banner to go at the bottom of the site that I'm not currently using. Now get out of Inspect Element!
the links: honestly whatever is leftover from the previous announcement. or, if you'd prefer, the first time around was the same link to my X, except labeled as "Secret X (formerly Twitter) link".

For reference, the links can be inserted by adding this just underneath the announcement blurb (with the paragraph tags):


<br>
    <div>
        <a href="https://x.com/thebrewergame" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secret X (formerly Twitter) link</a>
    </div>

As of thebrewergame.com v1.49, the website now checks what client a visitor is using. This is achieved through the MobileDeterminer() function. When pulling the announcement banner out of storage, be sure to locate the MobileDeterminer() function and, if necessary, adjust the quotes after the code "document.getElementById("announcementHeader").textContent =" to show an altered version of the announcement banner's header on mobile devices. The if statement this piece of code is inside of can also be adjusted to make other changes to the website for mobile devices, such as, in the context of the announcement banner, also adjusting the content of the banner. Also as of this version, the header for the announcement banner can be called on by the ID "announcementHeader" (as seen in the snippet of code aforementioned).

COUNTDOWN
In thebrewergame.com v1.49, code for a countdown was implemented ahead of Matthew's birthday on December 4. This code was initially for a countdown to Matthew's birthday, though following it, the countdown remained hidden in the code. To use it, locate the variable "countdownDate" and adjust accordingly. Then, make sure to change the completion message to something relevant by locating the line of code "document.getElementById("countdown").innerHTML =" and adjusting the text inside the quotes. Finally, wherever the countdown is desired, add the ID "countdown". For example, to have the countdown be in a paragraph tag, the paragraph tag would need to look like the following: "<p id="countdown"></p>". Do not put any text into the element as the countdown will replace it upon the JavaScript code being run. When the countdown is not in use, attach the "countdown" ID to the paragraph tag located inside the "countdownStorage" <div> to hide it. Do not adjust the code for the countdown, simply move the ID. This "countdownStorage" element is permanently set to "display: none;" in /src/styles/styles.css, the primary CSS stylesheet for the website.
