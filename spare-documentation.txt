Hi there! This is the text file of all of the spare bits of code for the thebrewergame/websites GitHub repo, the source code of the website thebrewergame.com. The documentation below covers a variety of things around the website.

SOCIAL COLOR LINKS
Social Color Links refers to whether or not the social platform links underneath the header "Find me elsewhere across the internet:" are colored with their respective platform colors. To achieve the coloring, src/styles/styles.css includes HTML classes for each of the platforms with their respective background colors, at the bottom of the file. Then, index.html calls on these classes through the [class="[class name]"] portion of the links just before the associated platform name. Below is an example of the X (formerly Twitter) button without the coloring:


<a href="https://x.com/thebrewergame" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X (formerly Twitter)</a>


...versus with, as introduced in thebrewergame.com v1.8:


<a href="https://x.com/thebrewergame" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="twitter">X (formerly Twitter)</a>


It is that [class="twitter"] that calls the respective HTML classes. To remove the coloring, you may either remove the [class="[class name]"] parts of the links in index.html, or remove the classes themselves in src/styles/styles.css, which look like the following as of thebrewergame.com v1.8:


.twitter{
    background-color: #008AD8;
    color: white;
}

.instagram{
    background-color: #F56040;
    color: white;
}

.substack{
    background-color: #FF6719;
    color: white;
}

.airchat{
    background-color: #3170e7;
    color: white;
}

.youtube{
    background-color: #FF0000;
    color: white;
}

.twitch{
    background-color: #6441a5;
    color: white;
}

In the case of thebrewergame.com/website, we keep the classes in src/styles/styles.css, and instead just remove the [class="[class name]"] from the links.

ANNOUNCEMENT BANNER
The Announcement Banner is an element of the website intended to be placed underneath the social links that can draw attention to something, say, well, an announcement. It features a header, paragraph, and space for links. It can be found just underneath the code for the social links, identifiable as the HTML class "announcement-banner." To take the banner live, fill the content as approperiate, remove the tags around the above <br> making it a comment, and in styles.css, find .announcement-banner and remove or switch to a comment the "display: none;". Then the banner is up and running! For reference, this is the default content for it when unused to say hi to the sneaky people using Inspect Element:

the header (h2): Shhh...
the paragraph (p): If you're reading this, it means that you're poking around where you shouldn't be. This surrounding code is for a hidden announcement banner to go at the bottom of the site that I'm not currently using. Now get out of Inspect Element!
the links: honestly whatever is leftover from the previous announcement. or, if you'd prefer, the first time around was the same link to my X, except labeled as "Secret X (formerly Twitter) link".
