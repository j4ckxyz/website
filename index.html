        <p>It's great to meet you. From a young age, I've always had a passion for writing, technology, hospitality and service, public speaking, and the outdoors. Over the years, I've done a number of things related to these passions; I wrote stories of varying length, worked hospitality gigs on Roblox when I was younger, created my own Roblox YouTube channel now known as "Brewer Studios," and even became a Roblox game developer myself, maintaining a number of projects and creating numerous one-off talent showcases before I parted ways with the platform. Nowadays though, I spend a great amount of time on the world's stage of social media while deepening my love for the hospitality and service industries, which I became fascinated with traveling the country with my parents growing up, and my presenting and voice work, particularly in announcements, with an interest in radio DJing.</p>
