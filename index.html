        <p>It's great to meet you. From a young age, I've always had a passion for writing, technology, the outdoors, and public speaking. Some around me growing up have said I'd be a fantastic lawyer or politician. But I've been more interested in the hospitality and service industries, which I developed a fascination for traveling the country with my family when I was younger. I'm aiming to become part of the next generation of receptionists, and maybe one day, I'll be greeting you from the opposite side of the front desk. Besides that, I spend a great amount of time on the world's stage of social media, and I enjoy the occasional dabble into various other interests of mine, including voice work, particularly announcements, with an interest in radio DJing.</p>
