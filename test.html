        <p>Hello! This is the secret test subpage of thebrewergame.com, used to see how Cloudflare Pages handles subpages. In particular, how it automatically handles chopping off file extensions at the end of page routes. This is outlined in the Cloudflare Pages documentation "Serving Pages". While you're here, I've got nowhere else around this website to send you, so instead, I highly recommend checking out PacificCreative over on Twitch! She primarily does Sims stuff, and I've really been enjoying catching her streams over the past eight months as of September 5, 2024.</p>
