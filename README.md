### Alternative URLs

Alternatively, from thebrewergame.com, the Cloudflare Page is also accessible on both [matthewcbrewer.com](https://matthewcbrewer.com) and [matthewcmccaslin.com](https://matthewcmccaslin.com). I bought these both late at night on a whim when my decision-making wasn't at its peak, so I'd appreciate it if you used them sometime. At least they're a bit more professional than thebrewergame.com.

## Special thanks

[Adnan "Aridan" Bukvic](https://aridan.net/), aka actuallyaridan, for making the site possible by modernizing the code and pulling it out of 1992 in appearance
